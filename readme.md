Extractor.epub for VitalSource Bookshelf
========================================

This EPUB file allows you to convert books in VitalBook EPUBBook format into regular EPUB books.
By sideloading Extractor.epub, the content of other EPUBBooks loaded in Bookshelf can be packaged
into a regular EPUB file which you can then use on other ebook readers.

Usage
-----
* Sideload Extractor.epub into Bookshelf. See [here](https://support.vitalsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/203256896-Side-load-EPUB-files-to-Bookshelf-for-Mac-PC) for instructions.
* Open the book you want to extract. This is important, otherwise the extractor won't be able to access the book's files. You can close it once you opened it once in the session.
* You need to know the file name of the book you're trying to extract. It is typically the VBID with '.vbk' appended
  when you view the book's information (right click on the book and select 'Show Book Information...'). For the exact
  name, look in the folder where Bookshelf has downloaded all your books (typically in C:\Users\Public\Documents\Shared Books\VitalSource Bookshelf\VitalBook Library).
* Enter the name into the 'File name' box on Extractor.epub. Then click 'Extract'.
* When processing is finished, you will be presented with a download of the converted EPUB file.

For Vista users
---------------
Unfortunately, IE9 might not have the required features for this to work, and downloads don't seem to work in Awesomium.
Please use a more modern operating system or use the frontend/backend version of Extractor.epub.
